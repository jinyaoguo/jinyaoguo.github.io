        "text": "In this paper, we combine novel data on the universe of entrepreneurs between 2010 and 2023 with standarized tests, college application and the census of higher education in Brazil. We first discuss what does it mean to be good entrepreneur, and we develop several measures that allows us to pin down the link between college education and good entrepreneurship. On top of characterizing how different college degrees are correlated with entrepreneurial activity, we estimate causal effects using a regression discontinuity design which exploits the centralized admission system to public universities in Brazil. We adapt the IV VAM to inform policymakers not only whether investment in a specific degree promotes entrepreneurship, but also how these estimates compare across degrees, by holding outside options constant. Third, we test whether the effects on entrepreneurship are associated to social mobility or they are mostly concentrated on students with advantageous socio-economic backgrounds. Finally, we explore the role of peers on explaining the causal estimates, by testing differential slopes in the network's benefits across degrees",
